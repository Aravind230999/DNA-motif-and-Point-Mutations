# DNA-motif and Point Mutations

This weeks assignment covers two very intresting bioinformatics problems that involves working on DNA strings (concepts that we have seen so far, NOTHING NEW!). There are two problems in this asignment:

1. Find a motif sequence in a DNA sequence (you might want to use looping and subseting of strings)

2. Finding Point mutations between DNA sequences (algorithm similar to Nucleotide counting problem).

For both problems submit the appropriate python codes as .py files.

**Adding # comments to explain your is highly recommended as it will help you as well the readers to understand the code and subsequently debug them if there is any issues with it.**

The URL for this assignment needs to be submitted on or before 27-03-2020.
